# Instructions for learners for before & the start of the course 


## online platforms & logins

We will be running the course on MS Teams & this [online R platform](http://uclvldddtaeas01.xuclh.nhs.uk:4433).

You should have received a password from Richard Clarke. Tip that your login needs to be lowercase NOT UPPERCASE, and you will need to access from a UCLH computer – e.g. remotely via https://remote.uclh.nhs.uk/. When you get in it should look mostly like the image below, but you won’t have the ‘learning-datascience’ folder on the right.

To test it out (I’m aware this may be your first R experience !) 
Type 2+2 on the left.


This is allows you to run a version of R & RStudio on a server so that you don't need to install software onto your own computer. It also has the advantage that we can analyse sensitive data within NHS systems.

It is relatively easy (& free) to install R & RStudio on a personal computer & it will look very similar. Installing on work computers can sometimes be trickier.



### In case you also want to install R on a personal computer (not needed for this course)

Download and install R from [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

Download and install RStudio. This is a nice interface for R, and the easiest way to use it. Download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You want the FREE desktop version.


### Decide on the dataset you want to use for practice.

Workshop 7 of this course allows you to put some of what you have learnt into practise. You can either come in with your own dataset, and let us help you get started, or you can continue using the data we have provided.
