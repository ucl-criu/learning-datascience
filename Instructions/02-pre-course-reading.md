## Some inspirational pre-course reading

[How the BBC graphics team uses R](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535)

[Good-enough practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)
Focus on 'good-enough' approaches that all can aspire to (although not all essential when starting out).

[Straightforward advice on data organisation in spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)
Relevant for R too.

[Excel Hell & Pandemic pandemonium](https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/06/excel/)
More incentive, if you need it, to move away from the worlds spreadsheet program of choice.
