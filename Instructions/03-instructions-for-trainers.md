#### [collaborative document](https://nhs-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/mei_bai_nhs_net/ERBkMbqA6QVAo6DOtqNxVfQBBBwvGvroM5yO3e_3Vy_Xtg?e=TIhNZt) 
For sharing & monitoring learner progress. All can edit.
Open to NHS users. (In sharepoint because a googledoc was less easy for contribution from NHS email addresses).


#### Trainer Roles

Content delivery [Andy South] deliver content to the main room.
Learner support [Mei Bai] monitor learner responses, manage breakout rooms, chip in.
Learner support [Steve Harris] support individual learners in breakout rooms as required, feedback & chip in.


#### MS Teams details

Main room for content delivery - 2 breakout rooms for troubleshooting.

Meeting organiser [Andy] can upgrade others initially to an 'attendee' and then to 'presenter'. Presenters can also upgrade others. **We should probably upgrade all to presenters.**

Meeting organiser [Andy] can create the breakout rooms & allocate people to them. If a learner has a problem, we can allocate them to a breakout room & one of the other trainers to go in too. Rooms are initially closed and those allocated are not moved until the room is opened by the organiser. Those moved will be given a 10s warning.

In a breakout room learners can share their screen, a trainer can ask to 'Take control' and can potentially e.g. type into R console on the learners machine.

Both learner & trainer can press leave to exit breakout room & return to main room - may need to press 'Resume'.

The chat in Teams can be used for communication.


## General tips.
Powerpoint slides have some speaker notes switch to 'presenter view' to see.


### Tips on individual sessions.

#### The welcome slides.



#### 1: an R taster 

To give a quick taste of R & show what we will do in the course. Learners will be asked to type commands in R and see what happens. We don't expect learners to understand completely at this stage, we will return to concepts later. 

Check that learners have managed to login.

- Instructor start on ppt
- switch to live demo in RStudio to clone Github project 
- demo opening .R script & work through
- give learners time to type themselves & experiment.
[todo] decide whether to get learners, now or later to save a source file in another folder, maybe in next intro R session


#### 2: intro to R

Use the ppt - initially learners won't need to type. 

Can switch to RStudio to demo later parts - either copy & pasting or typing.


#### 3: data cleaning exercise

TODO andy to update this.

This does not include slides. Candidates navigate to the section of the handout, read it and follow the instructions there. 

The workshop aims to demonstrate the principles of tidy data. 

A 'dirty' version of the dataset is provided, as well as a clean one. 


#### 4: getting data into R

This includes both the slides and an additional R script. The instructor presents the slides, and the candidates can follow along using the R script. Demonstrates getting in some of the course datasets. 


#### 5: data visualisation with ggplot2

The workshop includes both the slides and the R script. At one point in the slides, candidates will be asked to open up the R script, and work through those examples. The R script should help them get a better idea of how small changes in the code can build on the same base graph. 

#### 6: data manipulation with dplyr



#### 7: practical challenge using UCLH or participant provided data

Opportunity for learners to take time to apply what they've been introduced to. They can either work with provided UCLH data or data they have brought themselves. Instructors will provide assistance as required.

Includes an R script which contains suggestions & questions for getting started. 

Learners will be challenged to share one novel plot they have made at the end of the session and talk about it fo a minute.


Thank you, and good luck!
