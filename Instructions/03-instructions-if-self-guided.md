## Instructions if self-guided

Here are instructions if you want to use these materials yourself without an instructor.

#### 0: intro
Read the [readme](https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/README.md) if you haven't already.

Follow the [pre-course instructions](https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/Instructions/01-pre-course-instructions.md)

Have a look at the [pre-course suggested reading](https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/Instructions/02-pre-course-reading.md)

#### 1: an R taster 

To give a quick taste of R & show what we will do in the course. Type commands in R and see what happens. We don't expect you to understand completely at this stage, we will return to concepts later. 

Run through this [powerpoint & follow instructions](https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/sessions/1-R-taster.pptx)

#### 1.1: the R taster script

From within RStudio open `sessions/1-R-taster-script.R` and run each line in turn.
