# UCLH Data Science Fellows Training 2021-2022

This repository contains training materials introducing R for the manipulation and visualisation of patient data. It assumes no knowledge of R, but is structured so that those who know some R can also benefit. It starts with a two day course and provides materials to take things further. 

These resources are part of a UCLH fellowship program developing the capacity of clinicians to use R and other modern data tools to manipulate hospital generated data. In the longer term the aim is to help clinicians develop modern, reproducible data workflows – ‘good enough’ scientific computing - to make their work more efficient. We will be working to improve the interfaces between these practices and the hospital data systems. Here is a [10 minute talk from the 2021 NHSR-community conference](https://youtu.be/R7uDB9iqlZY?t=19480) outlining the fellowship program.

## 2 day entry level course

The initial two day course was delivered online by Andy South. 

### Self instruction
