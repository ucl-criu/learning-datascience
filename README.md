# UCLH Data Science Fellows Training 2021


This repository contains training materials introducing R for the manipulation and visualisation of patient data. It assumes no knowledge of R, but is structured so that those who know some R can also gain insights. It starts with a two day course and provides materials to take further.

The initial two day course was delivered online by Andy South. 

# Self or guided instruction

If working through these resources on your own work through the [instructions & links here](https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/Instructions/03-instructions-if-self-guided.md).

The main aim of the course is to develop the capacity of clinicians to use R and other modern data tools to manipulate hospital generated data. 

In the longer term the aim is to help clinicians develop modern, reproducible data workflows – ‘good enough’ scientific computing - to make their work more efficient. We will be working to improve the interfaces between these practices and the hospital data systems.

Here is a [10 minute talk from the 2021 NHSR-community conference](https://youtu.be/R7uDB9iqlZY?t=19480) outlining the fellowship program.

# Mini reproducible examples

A series of [modular mini-examples](https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/examples-mini/_readme-examples-mini.md) demonstrating coding solutions to common issues for learners starting to deal with patient data.
