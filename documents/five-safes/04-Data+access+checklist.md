Data access checklist
=====================

These checklist items are mapped against the [Five Safes at
UCLH](file:///C:\wiki\spaces\CRIU\pages\755990529\Five+Safes+at+UCLH) .

Safe people 
------------

-   all individuals have substantive contracts or educational
    relationships with higher education or NHS institutions

<!-- -->

-   those working need to have evidence of experience of working with
    such data (e.g. previous training, previous work with ONS, data safe
    havens etc.) or they need a supervisor who can has similar
    experience

<!-- -->

-   those working need to undergo training in information governance and
    issues with statistical disclosure control (SDC)

Safe projects
-------------

-   projects must \'serve the public good\' 

<!-- -->

-   projects must meet relevant HRA and UCLH research and ethics
    approvals

<!-- -->

-   service delivery work mandated as per usual trust processes

Safe settings
-------------

-   working at UCLH in the NHS on approved infrastructure

    -   UCLH local and remote desktops

    -   UCLH Data Science Desktop

    -   EMAP

Safe outputs
------------

-   outputs (e.g. reports, figures and tables) must be non-disclosing 

<!-- -->

-   outputs should remain on NHS systems initially

<!-- -->

-   a copy of all outputs that are released externally (documents)
    should be stored in one central location so that there is visibility
    for all

Safe data
---------

-   direct identifiers (hospital numbers, NHS numbers, names etc) should
    be masked unless there is an explicit justification for their use

<!-- -->

-   data releases are proportionate (e.g. limited by calendar periods,
    by patient cohort etc.)

<!-- -->

-   further work to obscure or mask the data is not necessary given the
    other safe guards (as per the recommendation by the UK data service)
