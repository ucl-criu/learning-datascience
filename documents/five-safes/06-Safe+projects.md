Safe projects
=============

We have adopted and adapted the ONS Data Ethics Advisory Committee\'s
[application
form](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DEA_Research_Project_Application_v1.2.docx).Â \
Where you have an existing IRAS form, we have indicated the sections
that can be directly copy-and-pasted into this application.

You can download our version with the link below.

The project application headings are summarised below

1.  **Application Type: Research or Exploratory analysis**\
    *Most applications will require formal research approval, but there
    are circumstances where the work will be exploratory. This will need
    to be justified to the UCLH data access committee.*

2.  **Project Lead**\
    *Name and details with comment on whether the lead will also view
    the data or just the derived outputs*

3.  **Researcher Team**\
    *Name and details of all members plus guidance as to whom the
    project lead is deputising*

4.  **Research Sponsor**\
    *Have you been commissioned to perform this research for another
    organisation?*

5.  **Title of the research project**\
    And estimated duration of the project

6.  **Abstract of the research project**\
    *Include a short description of the project and its benefits, in no
    more than 100 words.*\
    *or* IRAS Section A6-1 "Summary of the study" (300 words)

7.  **Purpose of Research Project**\
    *Provide a detailed description of the purpose for which the data
    are requested, describing the aims of the study/research in no more
    than 500 words. Where research is part of a larger programme please
    include details below.*\
    *or* IRAS Section A12. "What is the scientific justification for the
    research?"

8.  **Research Methodology**\
    *Provide details of the research protocol or methodology (e.g. data
    linkage or matching, statistical modelling etc) and how you intend
    to use the data, in no more than 1000 words.*\
    *or* IRAS Section A13. "Please give a full summary of your design
    and methodology"

9.  **Data Required**

    1.  *List the data sources, the patient cohorts and the timer
        periods you wish to examine. Give as much detail as possible on
        the exact data items you require.*

    2.  *Describe what portions of the data **will** be or **might** be
        identifiable using the framework below. For example, you might
        require hospital number to link to other data items (a direct
        identifier). However, you might also require date of birth to
        define age, this might be an identifying with other
        information.*

        1.  **Direct identifiers**\
            e.g. names, NHS number, hospital number etc.

        2.  **Indirect identifiers**\
            e.g. date of birth, diagnosis, the first 3 letters of a
            postcode etc.

        3.  **Non-identifying variables**\
            e.g. heart rate, creatinine, urine volume

        4.  **Free text**\
            Where under normal circumstances de-identification is not
            guaranteed

    3.  Other data sources\
        *If you intend to bring in any data for your project, give
        details of the data including who the owner is and provide
        evidence that the owner has given permission for their data to
        be used by you for this research.*

    4.  Justification for access to this rather than existing or public
        data\
        *Explain why access to legally protected (unpublished) data is
        needed. Please state what other data sources have been
        considered and why they are not sufficient for your purposes.*

10. **Data linkage**\
    *Does your project include any linking of data sources (as defined
    within the application guidance)? If yes, provide the following
    details below:*\
    - *description of the data sources(s) to be linked*\
    - *summary of the key variables;*\
    - *summary of the linking methodology; and*\
    - *the justification for the linking.*

11. **Ethics**\
    *You will need to provide evidence of an ethics consideration for
    your research project.*\
    *Have you had ethical approval for this project from your
    organisation or elsewhere?*

12. **Public Good**

    5.  *Please describe how your research project will provide a public
        good.*\
        *Complete all the sections that apply (e.g.* Provide an evidence
        base for health care including direct patient or health system
        benefit)

    the unpublished data?*\
    *Note: if applying for exploratory analysis, access will be granted
    for a maximum of 12 months*

14. **Publications**\
    *In order to access unpublished data for research purposes, you must
    promise* *that your findings will be made* *publicly available.*
    *Exemptions may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.*\
    *Note: If you are applying for exploratory analysis, no publications
    are permitted.*\
    - *How do you intend to make your research available to the
    public?*\
    - *Which specific journals, websites or reports do you intend to use
    to publish this research?*\
