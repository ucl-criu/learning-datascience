## Pre-requisites

- UCLH Data Science desktop. You should have received this link, let us know if you don't have access. 

[https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/instructions/01-pre-course-instructions.md](https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/instructions/01-pre-course-instructions.md)  

- Access [Collaborative document](https://nhs-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/mei_bai_nhs_net/ERBkMbqA6QVAo6DOtqNxVfQBBBwvGvroM5yO3e_3Vy_Xtg?e=TIhNZt) for tracking progress, entering questions etc.   


- Backup plan : if need to run locally download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)




### Course schedule

- 2 days of intensive learning [link to schedule](https://github.com/uclh-criu/learning-datascience/blob/master/instructions/schedule.md)

- we will be flexible & adapt as needed


## What to expect from the sessions

- we will follow a learning by doing approach
- getting you interacting with R early

- don't worry if you don't understand everything at the start
- do feel free to ask us questions at any time


I expect to fail to avoid doing these at some point :

a) assume you know things that you don't
b) patronise you by explaining things you already know

Please feel free to tell me.


# Thank you. We hope you enjoy the course.
