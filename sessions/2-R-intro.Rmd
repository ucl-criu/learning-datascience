## Content

- Motivation for R: what and why?
- R studio: a tour
- R building blocks
- Using/Writing functions 

## What is R?

- Free software for statistical computing, plotting (and almost anything else you can think of)
- Works on all platforms
- Built around handling data
- NOT just for statistics


## Why use R?

- Why?
    - You can do *anything*
    - Not limited to the pre-designed command process of an app.
    - Can record everything you do, so can be repeated with one click
- Hurdles
    - Need to learn a new language
    - Little 'point and click'
    - Need to describe to the computer the steps you want it to take

## Really, why R?

- Save time
    - Small upfront investment for long term gain
    - New data? - Easy
    - Repeat analysis? - Easy
    - Found an error? - Easy
- Reproducible Science
    - Code makes your analysis explicit
    - Writing code = writing lab-book = good reproducible science

## R versus Python

- almost anything you can do in one you can also do in other
- what are people around you using ?
- R is commoner in Research, Python in software engineering
- R for Research, Python for production

## R versus Python - my imperfect analogy
![](../images/01-r-python-bike-analogy.png)

## R communities

- big improvement over past 10 years
- now much more beginner friendly
- efforts to increase under-represented groups e.g. [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/)
- Twitter e.g. [#rstats hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query), [a tweet from yesterday](https://twitter.com/rfunctionaday/status/1429296120568721425)

## data & R in the NHS

"the NHS is failing to make the most of its data because there are not enough people with the right analytical skills to make sense of the information being collected"

"Communities need to share languages and common tools to work and grow together. R and Python are both free, open source, state of the art ..."

"We need to create a culture of ‘build it once, share the methodology and learn with others’"

## Return to looking at RStudio live (switch between slides & RStudio as needed)


## 3 Main R Building Blocks

- Objects
    - named objects store data (& other things)
- Functions
    - Little factories
    - Take an input (raw material) use function (factory) get an output (product)
- Packages
    - collections of objects (data) and functions
    - provide additional functionality

## Objects

- You assign names to objects in R.
- This is the assignment operator `<-`
- Return the stored value by typing the name.

```{r}
practice <- 2 + 2
practice
```


## Names

- You can store any object under a name.
- This example stores a string. You need to use quote marks to assign it.

```{r}
say_hello <- "hello"
say_hello
```

- Note that R does not like spaces in names.
```{r, error = TRUE}
say hello <- "hello"
```


## Vectors

- for R a vector is a container with elements of the same type.
    - A vector of integers - an example would be age
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19, 48)
```
    - A vector of real numbers - an example would be temperature.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(37.5, 37.1, 37.3, 38.3, 37.4, 38.9)
```
    - A vector of characters - an example would be name.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James")
```
    - A vector of logicals - an example would be 'are the blood results available?'
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
```
    
## Naming vectors.

The `c()` function combines individual values into a single vector.
```{r}
# Storing several ages in one vector.
age <- c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19)
age
# Storing several names in one vector.
name <- c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer")
name
```

## Accessing elements of a vector

- R creates an index for each element of the vector.
- It allocates a number to each element within the vector from left to right, starting with `1`.

```{r}
# The age of the second person.
age[2]
# The age of the fourth person.
age[4]
# The name of the fifth person.
name[5]
```

## Data Frames.
- A data frame is a series of vectors aligned to form a table
- Each vector becomes a column in the table
- A properly formatted excel spreadsheet is essentially a data frame

- Here we can create a new vector for gender
- and combine the 3 vectors (name, age, gender) into a dataframe
```{r, echo = FALSE}
gender <- c("male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female")
data.frame(name, age, gender)
```



## Creating a data frame - excercise

- Create and name vectors containing information about these 6 patients.
    - `Name: "Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer"`
    - `Age: 50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19`
    - `Gender: "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female"`
- Quotation marks are not needed for names in R, but are when your data is a string e.g. "male", "female"
- As a rule:
    - Characters on the left side of the assignment operator. No quote marks.
    - Characters on the right side of the assignment operator. Use quote marks if storing letters.

## Creating a data frame - exercise
- Combine these vectors into a data frame using `data.frame()`
    - Hint, the vector names need to go inside the `()`
- Save the data frame under the name `patients`
- Print the data frame called `patients` to your console

## Creating a data frame - solution


```{r}
# Creating individual vectors.

name <- c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer")
age <- c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19)
gender <- c("male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female")


# Combining into a data frame.

patients <- data.frame(name, age, gender)
```

## This is the data frame.
```{r}
patients
```

- R arranges the vectors as columns in the data frame
- R names the columns of the data frame after the names of the vectors
- R numbers each row of the data frame

## Recalling a vector in a data frame
- Data frame columns are vectors.
- `$` can be used to extract a vector from a data frame.
- We can get the `age` column from the data frame `group`
```{r}
patients$age
```

## Vectors - other properties
- Add a value of TRUE to a vector of integers
- Give it a name
- Recall the vector
- Use `str()` to examine the structure of the vector.
- What has happened?

## Vectors - other properties

```{r}
test <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, TRUE)
test
str(test)
```

- The value of `TRUE` has been changed to 1.
- The vector is still a numeric vector

## Vectors - other properties
- Add a string to a vector of integers
- Recall the vector
- What has happened?

## Vectors - other properties

```{r}
test2 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, "hi")
test2
str(test2)
```


- The string has been added on to the end of the vector.
- The vector is now a string vector.

## Functions as factories

## Functions as factories
![](../images/Function3.png)


## Functions

- You can think of them as a factory
- Usually labelled as a verb (they are "doing" something)
- Many come built into R
    - `Sys.time()`
    - `mean(1:100)`
- You can also install 'packages' containing bundles of functions

- View each function as a separate separate factory in a production line

## Functions in a line
![](../images/Function4.png)

## Functions
- You have been using functions already!
- `data.frame()` is a function.
- `age, gender, weight` are arguments.

```{r}
data.frame(name, age, gender)
```

- The data frame is the output

## Try these functions yourself. What do they do?
- Use the `group` data frame as the argument.

- `head()`
- `tail()`
- `summary()`
- `mean()`

## Try these functions yourself.
- `head()` Gives you the first 6 rows
- `tail()` Gives you the last 6 rows
- `summary()` Gives an overview of the object
- `mean()` Gives the mean of a numeric vector

## Warning note
- Functions are carrying out pre-written instructions
- They will fail if they are supplied with the wrong kind of data - they will return an error message instead
- Try `mean(group$gender)`

## Help with functions
- How do you find out how to use a particular function?
- Three ways:
    - Select the `help` tab in bottom right of RStudio, then type the function name into the search box, and read the help page.
    - Type `?function_name` into the console.
    - If you can’t remember the exact function name try typing `??whatever_you_want_to_do` into the console. It searches the whole database for matching terms.

::: notes
Get them to look up the help page for mean
:::

## This is what a help page looks like.
![](../images/HelpPage.png)

## Reading the help page

- detailed & contains a lot of info you don't need (I don't understand all of it).
- Usually a standard format:
    - Brief description
    - An example of use
    - The argument(s) that can be passed to the function - along with any default value it takes if there is no value provided.
    - Argument details
    - A reproducible example of use, that you can normally copy & paste

    
## Explore functions yourself

- Look up the function `head`
- What are the arguments you can give the function?

    - How do you specify the argument for 'n'? Try it

    - Try copy & pasting some of the examples


## Packages - collections of functions

There are bunch of functions that come with R. They are 'base R' functions.  


Extra functionality in packages.  


- Currently, the CRAN package repository features [18073](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) available packages.  


Anyone can create & share packages.

## To access a package, 2 step process

1. `install.packages("[package name]")`
2. `library([package name])`
   \n

Lightbulb analogy

1. install lightbulb - do once (update ~ yearly)
2. library - do every time you start R / enter room
   \n
We have already installed required packages for you.   
   \n
Limitations to installing packages on some NHS systems.

## Useful packages

These are some packages we will use in the course.

- `ggplot2` - plots graphs in R
- `readr` - imports data into R
- `stringr` - helps you manipulate strings
- `lubridate` - helps you manipulate dates

These are all part of the `tidyverse` - you can load all of them with `library(tidyverse)`

`tidyverse` packages are designed to work with **tidy data** that we will talk about later.
